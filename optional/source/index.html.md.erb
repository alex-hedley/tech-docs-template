# About the [name of API] API

Use this section to start your documentation with a short overview of:

- what your API does and does not do
- whether your API is in the alpha, beta or live phase
- the benefits of using the API, so users can compare it to other APIs
- whether itâ€™s free to use
- whether your users need to build or buy anything before they use it (technical prerequisites)
- who can use your API, and any restrictions on using it or its data

Avoid trying to sell your API. Describe features as benefits for your users instead.

Keep your introduction short, so your users can read and understand it easily. For example see the [GOV.UK Platform as a Service (PaaS) introduction page](https://docs.cloud.service.gov.uk/#gov-uk-platform-as-a-service).

You can read more about [documentating APIs](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-to-document-apis).
